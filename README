            InvalidPasswordException
            InvalidUsernameException

FUNCTIONS
    login(username, password)
        Just login into spotify. This is usefull, because users from unsupported
        countries have to login thru IP from supported country every ~twoweeks, or
        their account is frozen until they do so.
        
        Raise:
         - SpotifierException if there is some problem.
    
    register(username, password, email, gender, date_of_birth_ts)
        Register new account, raise proper exceptions if there is a problem:
         - InvalidUsernameException
         - InvalidPasswordException
         - EmailTakenException
         - InvalidGenderException is raised when gender parameter is not "male"/"female"
         - SpotifierException is raised in other cases (see .value for details from
           server)
        
        Email is not verified, so you can use pretty much everything.
        
        Bevare of date_of_birth_ts timestamp - spotify won't let you register too 
        much young accounts, so in case of trouble, try subtracting 567648000 for 18
        years.
